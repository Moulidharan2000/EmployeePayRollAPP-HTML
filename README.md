# EmployeePayRollAPP-HTML
The basic Employee Payroll web page is created by using HTML, CSS and JavaScript used to add some employee's details like name, gender, department, salary range and we can also select profile pictures and give notes/feedbacks. In this project the HTML is used to create the head and body parts and the CSS is used to style the html contents and the event listener from javascript is used for the salary range. 
The HTML and CSS are in separated files we can use the style contents in html using link tag and the javascripts content using inline script using script tag.
